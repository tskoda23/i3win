# TODO

## Functional

    -   in split layout, remove extra space between windows
    -   command to move window to start/end
    -   can't move windows with admin right unless this program is also ran with admin rights
    -   add keyboard shortcut to minimize window
    -   change stacked layout to align windows horizontally
    -   focus when switching workspaces

## UI Stuff

    -   add tray icon (show active workspace number)
    -   hide terminal window when program is running
    -   draw borders around active window

## Configuration

    -   check if config file exists

## Performance

    - avoid redrawing layout if no new windows appear

## Bugs

    - if caps lock is used as modifier key, we should disable its default behaviour completely
    - main window size should maybe be applied per-workspace, not globally
    - if only one window in layout, it should take full size

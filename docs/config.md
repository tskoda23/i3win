# Configuration

Program configuration is in `%AppData%\i3win` folder. Here is the list of all available options along with their default values:

- `MAIN_WINDOW_WIDTH_PERCENTAGE`=`50` - sets the width of [the main window](docs/concepts.md)
- `ADDITIONAL_WINDOW_PADDING`=`0` - sets additional spacing between the windows. It can be set to a negative value to achieve small window overlap. Currently only applied to split layout.
